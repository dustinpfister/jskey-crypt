# simple_crypt_fs

Some additional methods that can be used with simple_crypt that have to do with file io tasks. The idea was to pull file system methods out of simple_crypt and have them there. It also uses simple_crypt as a dependency.

## Might remove

As of 1.x the plan is to make jskey_crypt more minimal and as such the project might just have to do with piping data in and out via the standard input and output. As such this might get removed, or just become vestigial.

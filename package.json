    "description": "So I started a project called jskey that aims to be a markdown editor, and keyword database management tool that has a great deal a functionality and features both built in and extensible via a plug-in system. However I did not get far, as I think that I was trying to do way to much all within a single application. So now I am trying out an approach that involves breaking things down into a whole bunch of smaller independent applications that can potentialy be used together.",
